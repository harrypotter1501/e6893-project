       "[{'content': \"Mark Antony gave Cleopatra three bejeweled eggs as a wedding gift. One of them has been lost to history. FBI agent John Hartley (Dwayne Johnson) is working with Interpol to catch jewel thieves trying to steal all the eggs. He catches Nolan Booth (Ryan Reynolds) but a tip from the mysterious Bishop (Gal Gadot) has Hartley entangled with the crime.This film costs Netflix $200 million. Maybe it's worthwhile for its streaming purposes. For me, it's not worthwhile for its cinematic purposes. There is no doubt that this has plenty of star power. On its face, this trio should make a fun slick action comedy but it struggles to build chemistry. Right from the start, there is something unreal about this more than its ridiculous superhero action structure. There is something wrong with the character Hartley being imprisoned by the Russians. It doesn't make sense. It may not matter to some but it's hella annoying to me. I started to expect The Rock to turn. In fact, I suspected a full heel turn during the fight in the gunrunner's vault. Even after the turn, this movie still doesn't make sense. Again, most people could not care less but it is very annoying to me.The bigger issue may be a need for better chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and The Rock. It should be the easiest thing in the world but Hartley's character is hounded by my suspicions. That prevents the chemistry to truly take hold. I'd rather they do it straight like 48 Hrs. I would also put Gal Gadot into the Inspector Urvashi Das role. I make The Bishop as the ubervillain and the trio can team up to take him down. This one feels very desperate to be slick fun rather than actually being that. I'm guessing that they expect to do more of these movies but I don't see how.\",\n",

Even Gal Gadot who I like and find quite attractive in general, but have not enjoyed acting wise as much, is quite fitting overall.Ryan Reynolds is his usual funny self - stealing the show if you allow the pun. Even though he wasn\\'t a producer on this and only \"acting\" in this one. He said in interviews that it was quite freeing (a Free guy at last, sorry had to) - experience wise.

Throw in Gal Gadot as The Bishop and a foil for both men, and you've got a fast paced flick that darts around the world with the trio pulling off their various antics. With the three of them turning up all over the place these days, I guess it was a natural that they wind up in a film together. The plot makes me wonder though, how long film makers will continue to resort to Nazi treasures from World War II; there can't be too many of those still hanging around by now. In any event, the fairly clich√©d story is livened up by the sudden change of locales, the brisk pace, and the effective chemistry between the principal players, even when they find themselves on opposite sides of the plot. Nice work too from Ritu Arya as Inspector Urvashi Das; I'd like to see her turn up in the sequel.\",\n",

After their deaths the eggs were lost until two were discovered in 1907. One is in a Rome museum, one is owned by Sotto Voce, an arms dealer, and the other is still lost.After a tip off from an art thief known as 'The Bishop, 'FBI Profiler Special Agent John Hartley believes that rival art thief Nolan Booth is planning to steal the first egg so heads to Rome with Interpol agent Urvashi Das and a team of police to arrest him. The operation appears to go well but the egg disappears; Hartley is accused of being involved and finds himself in the same Russian jail cell as Booth. Hartley wants to clear his name and arrest the thieves but to do that he will have to form an unlikely alliance with Booth and seek the eggs. Before the adventure is over they will have visited several countries and faced various dangers. There will also be further twists.It must be stated that this is a fairly silly film that requires the viewer to suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride; if one can do that it is rather fun. There is a lot of action in a series of exciting set pieces; fights; chases, shooting and explosions but nobody is seen to be killed. There are plenty of laughs to be had; usually provided by the banter between Booth and Hartley. The three leads; Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds and Gal Godot put in solid and enjoyable performances as Hartley, Booth and The Bishop; other notable performances come from Ritu Arya as Urvashi Das and Chris Diamantopoulos as Sotto Voce. Overall I'd say this is well worth watching if you want a brain-in-neutral thrill ride with excitement and laughs but not much to cause offence.\",\n",

Had I heard about the movie prior to finding it on Netflix? Nope. But then again, I don\\'t really bother keeping up with trailers and forthcoming releases.Writer and director Rawson Marshall Thurber definitely managed to put together a very entertaining and wholesome storyline and plot for \"Red Notice\". And it was a story that contains a good amount of action, comedy, thrills and plot twists. So yeah, I was certainly entertained from the very beginning and up to the end. And I must also admit that some of the plot twists were rather enjoyable and some that I hadn\\'t foreseen coming.Needless to say that with a cast that includes Ryan Reynolds, Gal Gadot and Dwayne Johnson, then of course you are in for a stellar time with great performances. And the three lead performers definitely delivered. It should be noted that the performance from Chris Diamantopoulos and Daniel Bernhardt were also good, just wish that the latter had a bigger part to play in the movie.\"Red Notice\" takes you all across the world in a wonderful heist adventure with interesting characters, fast paced action, good comedy and also good dialogue. And the fact that the movie was very dynamic in its cinematography definitely helped to sell the movie.You should certainly sit down to watch \"Red Notice\" if you get the chance.My rating of \"Red Notice\" lands on a very well-deserved eight out of ten stars.',\n",

       " {'content': 'This film begins with a story about three jewel-encrusted, golden eggs presented to Cleopatra from Mark Antony before their deaths. Needless to say, they are quite valuable with the first being displayed at the Museo Nazionale di Castel Sant\\'Angelo in Rome, the second one owned by a private collector and the third having never been found. So, when the word goes out that a rich Egyptian billionaire will pay $300 million for all three of these eggs to present at his daughter\\'s upcoming wedding, \"Special Agent John Hartley\" of the FBI immediately heads to Rome in anticipation of a heist. However, when he and Interpol agent \"Urvashi Das\" (Ritu Arya) arrive at the museum they discover that the egg has been stolen only minutes before by an infamous jewel thief named \"Nolan Booth\" (Ryan Reynolds). Naturally, a manhunt is immediately ordered but complicating matters is the fact than an even more notorious jewel thief by the name of \"The Bishop\" (Gal Gadot) also wants all three eggs and she is even better at this business than Nolan Booth. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say this was an enjoyable action film for the most part with some good comedy thrown into the mix as well. Admittedly, some of the action scenarios were a bit too far-fetched in my opinion, but all things being considered I found this to be an entertaining movie all the same and I have rated it accordingly.

It is also one of those buddy comedy films, though of course with these films the buddies tend to go together like chalk and cheese. Actually, one of the characters is an FBI agent who is trying to track down one of these thieves, while the other is a professional thief, apparently the best in the world, that his until his main rival steps in a manages to outsmart him.I have found heist films to be a little dull and boring of late, namely because a lot of them simply boil down to them basically pulling off a major heist, and then going off and living a life of luxury. This film changes track by mixing a lot of elements that you would expect from an Indiana Jones film, which is why I actually really liked it. Actually, come to think of it, I felt that the chemistry between Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds was pretty good as well, especially since they team up to try and take down the other thief.The concept of the Red Notice is that it is a notice that is issued by Interpol that the person on the notice is wanted by one of the member state's authorities. It isn't an arrest warrant, it is just a notice, and the authorities can act on it or not. Of course, our heroes happen to be international criminals, which is basically why Interpol is involved - they are really only interested in trans-national crimes, and this is because the thieves that we are interested in are somewhat experts at getting into and out of places that they aren't supposed to.Okay, it does lack the mysticism that the Indiana Jones' films are famous for, and rather it tends to focus mostly on treasures and artwork, and of course the thieves making plans to attempt to break into places that are basically impossible to break into. However, it is actually a pretty cool, and quite an enjoyable film, but then again a lot of Dwayne Johnson's films are like that. Oh, and the other thing is that there are some pretty interesting twists in this film as well. Yeah, it's pretty enjoyable, and certainly does work quite well. Sure, it may not be one of the best films out there, but it is till quite worth watching.\",\n",

       " {'content': '\"Red Notice\" is one of those all-out fun movie that one never gets tired of watching, well, from time to time and in the right mood. The remuneration of the three leads likely took a hurting bite from the total budget. There is another one though, playing the stereotyped law enforcer that has been taken for a ride, right from the beginning, all the way to the end. This is played by lovely Ritu Arya (\"The Umbrella Academy\" TV series), together with her music-like British diction.The main plotline is about stealing three \"Cleopatra\\'s eggs\", the first one from a museum, the second from a private and the third from a location not yet known. We have an odd couple alliance between the two male leads, which they emphasize is not a partnership but a \"marriage of convenience\" in which each wants \"to get a divorce, keeping the kids\".Among many things in this \"Raider genre\", this movie has the must-have round-the-world tour setup. Starting in Rome, no time is lost in introducing the audience to a pair of law enforcers, FBI John Hartley (Dwayne Johnson) and Interpol (Ritu Arya) catch Nolan Booth (Ryan Reynolds), the second best thief in the world, hot in the act of stealing the \"egg\", only to lose him again. Sweeping though Bali, Rome (again) London and Russia, the plotline is firmed up as the abovementioned \"marriage\" between Booth and Hartley (allegedly framed), to steal the second egg for the world\\'s best thief The Bishop (Gal Gadot), who plays them like two puppets on a string.For the rest of the movie, I would just say: enjoy the roller coaster ride. One more thing to mention is that this movie is not shy in referencing, making tribute to other movies/shows. The theme from Raider of the Lost Ark is used, with characters actually mentioning that movie. Ed Sheeran appears in person and make reference to his cameo appearance in Game of Thrones. These are just two of many examples.',\n",

       " {'content': '\"Red Notice\" is an Action - Comedy movie in which we watch an Interpol agent trying to track down the most notorious thief. Everything falls apart due to the occurrence of some unexpected events and something has to be done to change it.I enjoyed this movie because it had an interesting plot, filled with plenty of action scenes and much of suspense. The combination of comedy with action was very good and created a nice atmosphere in the movie. The interpretations of Ryan Reynolds\\' who played as Nolan Booth, Gal Gadot\\'s who played as The Bishop and Dwayne Johnson\\'s who played as John Hartley were very good. The direction which was made by Rawson Marshall Thurber was equally good with the interpretations of the cast, and he presented very well both the plot and his main characters. Finally, I have to say that \"Red Notice\" is a nice, entertaining movie and I recommend you to watch it because you will laugh and you will have a great time.',\n",

Taking these characters into an action packed ride with a side of laughs.I actually enjoyed the film more than I thought I would. Lots of action and humor. A story about a FBI profiler John (Dwayne Johnson) joining an Interpol agent Das (Ritu Arya) to help track down one of the highest skilled thief con artist Nolan (Ryan Reynolds). Who is on a track of trying to steal three of Cleopatra's golden eggs. When Nolan is caught and John is set up by another skilled con artist known as the Bishop (Gal Gadot). Nolan and John in a Russian prison. They both try to join forces to escape and chase down the Bishop before she can get her hands on the eggs. And John clearing his name.The film is action packed. And a lot of fun seeing Ryan Reynolds and Dwayne Johnson banter at each other throughout. Johnson being a brute and Reynolds being the wise cracking talker. And Gal being a skilled fighter. The film is fast paced. Lots of fun set pieces. And humor.Director Rawson Marshall Thurber knows how to handle the action sequences. Taking these characters into a fun Indiana Jones mixed with a bit of National Treasure ride. Great cast ensemble. The film does have a twist that is fun and entertaining. Which leaves you wanting more after it ends. I would love to see a sequel.Overall, Red Notice is a lot of fun, fast, action packed with some humor.\",\n",

       " {'content': \"It's been a few days since I sat down and watched Red Notice, yet despite only mere hours passing in time I find myself struggling to recall anything of note in a film that fails to create a spark of imagination or excitement.Costing $200 million to make and starring some of the entertainment industries most well-liked stars, Notice is a flashy Netflix exclusive that recently became the streaming services biggest day one hit but despite its high quality coat of paint, Rawson Marshall Thurber's lifeless and charmless action/comedy romp is an instantly forgettable and an incessantly bland blockbuster that is merely coasting along at all times.Spanning a global collection of locales, that often are infused with a seriously distracting amount of poorly done green screen due to the film having to shoot through the Covid-19 pandemic, Notice should be a fun and frantic jaunt across the globe as we follow Dwayne Johnson's Interpol agent John Hartley (proving once more he loves a dress up more than anyone), Ryan Reynolds (wouldn't have guessed it) smart mouthed thief Nolan Booth and Wonder Woman herself Gal Gadot as the mysterious Bishop as the trio hunt down some priceless egg artefacts and try outsmart each other along the way.Utilising a well-trodden path that was experienced by cinema fans with the likes of the Indiana Jones and early The Mummy franchises, Notice sadly lacks any of the smarts or style those type of entertaining romps possessed as Thurber struggles to bring much to the table when it comes to the action stakes, with many set pieces looking like a glorified video game rather than a top notch cinematic production, while his cast can't salvage the film from the boredom it will induce with fairly pedestrian turns that do nothing to enhance their reputations as Hollywood heavyweights.Recently announcing his break from Hollywood for the foreseeable future after a number of years plying away busily in a number of productions, Notice marks a new low for the career trajectory of Ryan Reynolds in particular who has become a walking and talking caricature of his real life persona mixed with Deadpool's initially charming boundary pushing and wisecracks.Trying little too do anything he hasn't done in his last handful of big films, Reynolds seems content to sleepwalk through his roles of recent times and his lethargy in bringing the potentially entertaining Booth to life here is a key example of just how tiresome and unenthusiastic this heist/adventure is, with Reynolds lame turn but one component of a film that does nothing too distinguish itself from the pack and seems content with merely existing rather than finding a reason to make us care or wish for more of where this came from.Final Say -A sadly typical Netflix waste of money, Red Notice should be a mindlessly entertaining and exciting ride but it's nothing more than a tiresome and trite example of modern day blockbuster film-making, the type of film-making that may get nice numbers to report on in regards to streaming performances but does nothing else worth remembering.1 1/2 Vin Diesel audition tapes out of 5.\",\n",

       " {'content': 'Was this story anything we haven\\'t seen before? Absolutely not. Was it mindless entertainment watching three of Hollywood\\'s top actors having fun? Absolutely yes.This was Netflix\\'s most expensive investment to date (200M, 60M being just the 3 leads salary), and I\\'m sure they will still make a profit, regardless of the negativity from the critics. I mean who the heck won\\'t pay to see any of these three actors individually, let alone all three together.The writing could\\'ve been slicker, instead of pretty much boilerplate cliched for this overused genre, but it was still a fun ride. There were some surprising twists and turns, and Ed Sheeran\\'s cameo appearance was priceless. All three A-listers had excellent chemistry, but Reynolds tipped the scales, as usual, in the laughter department. Reynolds is Hollywood\\'s \"Golden Boy of Humorous Entertainment\", and a gift to the rest of the world. On his own, or paired up with any actor, any film he is in, is fun as hell.The film was incredibly shot with amazing sets and landscapes, excellent cinematography and score, well directed and entertainingly written. The two-hour runtime flew by, I actually wanted more. I\\'m glad they closed out the film ready for a sequel, because I\\'d give anything to see these three together again. Ignore the picky critics; grab your favorite snacks and beverages, sit back and enjoy the fun ride. It\\'s a well deserved 8/10 from me.',\n",

       " {'content': \"Red Notice (2021) : Movie Review -Looking back at heist thrillers made in Hollywood, one can easily pick out best from recent franchise movies. Red Notice is a new attempt to glamorize those typical cliches and it definitely delivers what it promises from the trailer. It is not 'Mission Impossible' or 'Fast And Furious' Franchise Film but it makes a good combination of action packed entertainer and heist-thriller by altering many segments out of them. By the time we are going ahead with other franchise films and digital releases, Red Notice surely makes a fine popcorn entertainer for the weekend.An Interpol-issued red notice is a global alert to hunt and capture the world's most wanted. But when a daring heist brings together the FBI's top profiler John Hartley (Dwayne Johnson) and two rival criminals Nolan and Sarah (Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot), there's no telling what will happen. John is on the hunt while Nolan and Sarah are fighting to top each other. All this is just nothing in front of what film has to tell afterwards. Spoilers are strictly condemned here! Mouth shut. There are plenty of twists coming one after another, there's breathtaking action and then there is gripping screenplay. Those 90 minutes never look boring and that's the biggest triumph for Red Notice.When it comes to acting, these commercial potboilers aren't supposed to be tidy. Most of the people don't even care as far as they are enjoying explosive stuff. Red Notice is still decent there as Johnson looks pretty convincing as he carries his best suited macho image. Gadot sizzles in her Red Hot Avatar and in some scenes she beats out both the male forces. Compared to that, Reynold is quite a break as he succeeds to keep the humour alive. Talking about the action scenes and visuals, Red Notice gets a Green Signal. However, it is still red when it comes to using those old clinches. For instance, that smart heist in the beginning. You know how it's gonna happen and how it's gonna end cause all of it has been used hundreds of times before. We should be thankful to the action choreographer for literally taking away our breath a few times as well as the cameraman for those jittering close-up frames and superfast zooms.There isn't much to bash in this film but still if there's in anything, then it's stereotypes. Visually, it's a grand film and the production value is lavish too. Watching this film on Big-Screen will snatch away lot of shortcomings so it should be viewed accordingly. Action lovers have became used to all the tricks by now so, they won't be too harsh on Rawson Marshall Thurber, as a director. As a writer, he could have done better though. Summing up everything in short, Red Notice packs a solid punch of Action, Twists and Suprises in an old healthy heist drama.RATING - 6/10*\",\n",
